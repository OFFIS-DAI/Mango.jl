# Mango.jl

## Welcome to mango's documentation!

Mango.jl allows the user to create simple agents with little effort and at the same time offers options to structure agents with complex behaviour. The main features of mango are listed below.

Mango.jl as a package is partly based on the ideas of [mango-agents](https://mango-agents.readthedocs.io), but will also contain new concepts and techniques. It was made with the picture of scalable agent simulations in mind.

## Features
* Container mechanism to speedup local message exchange
* Structuring complex agents with loose coupling and agent roles
* Built-in codecs
* Supports communication between agents directly via TCP

## Development state
Mango.jl is in an early development state. Feel free to try out the framework if you are interested and be aware that there might be some unexpected edges here and there.

## License
Mango.jl is developed and published under the MIT license.
