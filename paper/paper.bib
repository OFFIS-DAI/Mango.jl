    abstract="Mesa is an agent-based modeling framework written in Python. Originally started in 2013, it was created to be the go-to tool in for researchers wishing to build agent-based models with Python. Within this paper we present Mesa's design goals, along with its underlying architecture. This includes its core components: 1) the model (Model, Agent, Schedule, and Space), 2) analysis (Data Collector and Batch Runner) and the visualization (Visualization Server and Visualization Browser Page). We then discuss how agent-based models can be created in Mesa. This is followed by a discussion of applications and extensions by other researchers to demonstrate how Mesa design is decoupled and extensible and thus creating the opportunity for a larger decentralized ecosystem of packages that people can share and reuse for their own needs. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and discussion of future development areas for Mesa.",

The goal of JADE is to simplify development while ensuring standard compliance through a comprehensive set of system services and agents. JADE offers an agent runtime system on which implement efficient FIPA 2000 compliant multi- agent systems and supports their development through the availability of a predefined programmable agent model and of a set of management and testing tools. This paper describes the main features of the JADE system and introduces some of the most important projects based on JADE software.},
